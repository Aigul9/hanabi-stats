1. Create a constraint
CREATE CONSTRAINT playerNameConstraint ON (player:Player) ASSERT player.name IS UNIQUE

2. Load nodes
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///players_cut.csv" AS csvLine
CREATE (p:Player { name: csvLine.name})

3. Select
MATCH (n:Player) RETURN n LIMIT 25
MATCH (p {name: 'Valetta6789'})-[r]-(t)
RETURN p, r, t
MATCH (p)-[r]-(t)
RETURN p, r, t
LIMIT 50

4. Load relationships
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///weights_cut.csv" AS csvLine
MERGE (player:Player {name:csvLine.player})
MERGE (teammate:Player {name:csvLine.teammate})
MERGE (player)-[:REL {weight: csvLine.weight}]-(teammate)

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///weights_easy.csv" AS csvLine
MERGE (player:Player {name:csvLine.player})
MERGE (teammate:Player {name:csvLine.teammate})
MERGE (player)-[:EASY {weight: csvLine.weight}]-(teammate)

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///weights_hard.csv" AS csvLine
MERGE (player:Player {name:csvLine.player})
MERGE (teammate:Player {name:csvLine.teammate})
MERGE (player)-[:HARD {weight: csvLine.weight}]-(teammate)

5. Delete a single node
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'UNKNOWN'})
DELETE n

6. Delete relationships
MATCH (n)-[r:REL]->()
DELETE r

7. Delete a node with all its relationships
MATCH (n {name: 'Andy'})
DETACH DELETE n

8. Delete everything
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n

9. Dump the db
setx JAVA_HOME -m "E:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12"
echo $env:JAVA_HOME
bin/neo4j-admin dump --database=neo4j --to=/dumps/neo4j/neo4j-<timestamp>.dump
